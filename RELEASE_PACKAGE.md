- Exports to JSON for integration

**Why it's different:**
- ASN-focused (not just domain enumeration)
- Complete vulnerability detection (CVE lookup built-in)
- Professional output formats
- POSIX-compliant (runs everywhere)
- No artificial limitations

**Perfect for:**
- Bug bounty hunters
- Security researchers
- Network administrators
- Security teams

**Try it:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASNSPY/asnspy-oss.git
cd asnspy-oss
./asnspy.sh AS15169 --profile deep
```
